# p5demo
Welcome to the ReadMe for your first p5 demo project!

This gives you the two simple files that will let you test your coding knowledge practically with the associated tutorial series. 

Goal: Draw cool stuff while learning about JS and Programming in General!

Milestones: When you get to a stopping point, show me!

Here are some instructions for you as you proceed through the project:


1: When Setting Up
  First clone the files on your machine:
  `git clone REPOURL`
  The URL is located in the URL bar in your browser or in the bar that appears when you click clone/download on the main page of the repo.
  
  For this kind of project (p5JS) that's about it.
  
  All you need to do from there is:
  
  From your file manager, within this project's folder open index.html in Chrome.
  
  It will display whatever you have written in scetch.js. (your first time it should show nothing)

  As we did with the Polymer Project, the process of testing your code is - write, save, reload the browser, repeat...

2: When Starting a Project
  So you are sitting down to start a project, here are the steps you should follow:

  Open the project folder in VS Code (open VSCode, file-openfolder, click on the project folder)
  
  Open the integrated terminal: ctrl ~
  
  Check which branch you are on: `git checkout`
  
  Switch to the "blank" branch I created for you: `git checkout blank`
  
  Create a branch for your project `git checkout -b BRANCHNAME` 
  
  Push the branch to the repo, so it knows what you are doing and where you are doing things: `git push --set-upstream origin BRANCHNAME`
  
  You are ready to get to work!

3: When Finished with a Project:
 
  First check what branch you are on: `git checkout` (change to/create the right branch if you are on the wrong branch)
  
  Second: Commit your code: `git commit -a -m 'YOURMESSAGE'`

  Third: Push your code: `git push`
  
  Fourth: Merge your code to the master branch `git checkout master` & `git push`
  
  Fifth: Get set up for the next project `git checkout blank`
