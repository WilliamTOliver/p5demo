# p5demo
Welcome to the ReadMe for your first p5 demo project!

This gives you the two simple files that will let you test your coding knowledge practically with the associated tutorial series. 

Goal: Draw cool stuff while learning about JS and Programming in General!

Milestones: When you get to a stopping point, show me! 

While in your project folder in power shell, after having made changes and saving. Type:
`git commit -a -m "COMMITMESSAGE"`
Then:
`git push` 
That tosses everything up onto this repo, where I can check it out upon your completion of whatever last tutorial you were on last.
